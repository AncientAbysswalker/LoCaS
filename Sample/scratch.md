# LoCaS Project

## Problem Statement
This project arose from one of my previous career positions. The company in question was very averse to change, and part of that meant that all of the software, databases, and parts information was based off of methods and software decades superceded. As my job dealt extensively with many of these areas, my resulting headaches had me thinking - "for sure I could make something better than thisâ€½"

## Solution
I decided to try my hand at making a sort of parts-cataloging software, to display the information that, in my experience, is very useful and should be readily accessible - which it unfortunately was not. I decided that the data should be logically organized and readily displayed in a way that it is easy to navigate and find out what parts inherit from others - which is also something that was a nightmare to try to figure out. Thus was born the name - Logical Cataloging Software, or LoCaS. Honestly a bit uninspired, but at least it's easy to say...

The vision for this project is outlined in the following points. 

* Bullet
* Kin
* Is
* BAE


## Planned
* Generalize SQL calls more to remove redundancies and unnecessary lines of code
* 

## Known Bugs
* The PDF open button still receives focus even though it should not
* Behavior between multiple tabs is not intended to function yet. Some features, like adding images, may work. They also may break the same features on the sample tab... -_-
*
